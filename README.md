# This demo application demonstrates the use of the (Digital Signature Services) DSS library to establish message security 
# in the context of the enhanced Peppol eDelivery communication infrastructure for financial messages in ISO 20022. 
# It aims to adhere to the specifications outlined in "https://anskaffelser.dev/payment/g1/docs/current/rulebook" and
# DSS "https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/DSS/webapp-demo/doc/dss-documentation.html#R02"(use of CAdES/ASiCE).

- The applications basic building blocks (in recommended review order)

* "DemoFilesAndConfig" - contains configuration and references to files, certificates and keystores.

a) "ASiCeBuilderApp" - demonstrates the signing of message content (content.xml, metadata.xml) using CAdES signature and the creation of the inner- and outer ASiC-E container.

b) "CryptoBuilderApp" - demonstrates the encryption (decryption) of the ASiCE container produced in previous step a).

c) "ASiCeCAdESLevelBValidationApp" - demonstrates the basic validation of an "inner ASiCE" and the creation of DSS validation reports using online OCSP lookup (isolated in OCSPLookupApp) and certificate trust store.

d) "ConstructStandardBusinessDocumentApp" - demonstrates the construction of the final "StandardBusinessDocument" XML message using the results of the building blocks demonstrated in a) and b).
